\section{Introduction}
Hickson Compact Groups (HCGs) are systems of typically four to ten groups of galaxies in close proximity to each other. 
They were first catalogued by Paul Hickson in \citeyear{1982ApJ...255..382H}. On large scales, they are located in low-density environment \citep{1995AJ....109.1476P}. 
Their galaxy members are characterized by low-velocity dispersion \citep[$\mathrm{\sim 200~km~s^{-1}},$][]{1992ApJ...399..353H} but are separated by small distances like in the center of clusters, making HCGs an ideal case to study gas and star formation quenching processes. According to the evolutionary sequence proposed by \citet{2001A&A...377..812V}, 
in phase 1, galaxies in HCGs have the majority of their neutral atomic hydrogen (\HI) gas in the disk of the galaxies. 
In phase 2, interactions between the member galaxies disturb the gas morphology and kinematics, and dislodge about 30 to 60\% of the gas from the disks to form features like tidal tails and bridges. In phase 3a, most or all the gas is found in the form of intragroup clouds or tidal tails. In phase 3b, the \HI\ in the groups forms a large 
cloud with a single peaked global profile and a single velocity gradient. However, the existence of this phase has been questioned by 
\citet{2023A&A...670A..21J} since, after further studies, only HCG 49 out of the 72 HCGs studied by \citet{2001A&A...377..812V} fell within this category. 
\citet{2023A&A...670A..21J} made a minor modification to the original evolutionary sequence of HCGs proposed by \citet{2001A&A...377..812V}. 
The first modification concerns the threshold at which groups are classified as being phase 2 or phase 3. \citet{2023A&A...670A..21J} 
redefined phase 2 groups as those where 25\% to 75\% of the \HI\ was associated with features not related to the disk of the galaxies. 
If more than 75\% of the \HI\ was associated with extended features, they classified the groups as phase 3. The second modification involved 
the elimination of the phase 3b classification and the introduction of phase 3c. They used this new designation scheme to specify HCGs that 
would have been classified as phase 1, but where only one galaxy among the group members was detected in \HI. Groups in phase 3c are thought 
to be at a late stage of their evolution but has recently acquired a new member galaxy. In this paper, we will use the new classification 
scheme by \citet{2023A&A...670A..21J}. \\

The \HI\ content of HCGs have been the subject of many studies in the literature. \citet{1987ApJS...63..265W} observed 51 HCGs using 
the NRAO 91 m and NAIC 305 m telescopes. They found that HCGs contain, on average, half as much \HI\ as loose groups of similar optical morphology and luminosity types. 
Their \HI\ mass is lower than the expected \HI\ mass from their optical morphology and luminosity types. \citet{1997A&A...325..473H} 
used the Effelsberg 100-m telescope to observe 54 HCGs at 21 cm wavelength. They detected \HI\ for 41 HCGs. The detection rate positively 
correlated with increasing number of spirals in the groups. \citet{1997A&A...325..473H} expanded their study by incorporating the sample from \citet{1987ApJS...63..265W}, 
resulting in a total of 75 HCGs, including 61 detections and 14 upper limits. \citet{1997A&A...325..473H} observed many HI-deficient groups by comparing 
their integrated \HI\ mass with their blue luminosity. \citet{2001A&A...377..812V} used single-dish data for 72 HCGs to examine their overall HI contents. In addition, they used high-resolution VLA mapping for 16 of these groups to investigate their \HI\ spatial distributions and kinematics in more details. They found that, on average, HCGs contain only 40\% of the expected \HI\ mass based on the optical luminosity and morphological types of the member galaxies. Although the more deficient groups showed higher X-ray detection rate than the less deficient one, suggesting the importance of phase transformation for the missing \HI, the results were not statistically significant; subsequent analysis showed no significant correlation between \HI\ deficiency and X-ray emission \citep{2008MNRAS.388.1245R}. \citet{2001A&A...377..812V} also found that the individual 
member galaxies have higher deficiency than the group as a whole, indicating the importance of gas removal processes from galaxies in HCGs. High angular resolution VLA observations showed that 70\% of the spiral galaxies had disturbed morphology and kinematics. However, they did not find a one-to-one 
correlation between the amount of \HI\ mass in tidal features and \HI\ deficiency. This may indicate a rapid evolutionary sequence once the gas is dislodged from the member galaxies. 
Our data will be crucial in investigating this scenario. \\
   
Our paper is motivated by GBT observations of 
\citet{2010ApJ...710..385B} and the VLA-based analysis of \citet{2023A&A...670A..21J}. \citet{2010ApJ...710..385B} observed the \HI\ spectrum of 26 galaxies, in which only one group was undetected. They detected diffuse \HI\ emission, spread 
over 1000 $km~s^{-1}$, which was missed by previous observations. \citet{2010ApJ...710..385B} quantified the newly observed \HI\ emission in terms of excess mass, 
which was defined as the difference between the mass measured by the GBT and the mass measured by the VLA ($M_{excess}=M_{GBT}-M_{VLA}$). The excess gas mass 
fraction ($M_{excess}=M_{GBT}-M_{VLA}/M_{GBT}$) were found to vary between 5\% to 80\%, and higher for more \HI\ deficient groups. 
The result suggested that at least part of the missing \HI\ was in the form of a faint, diffuse \HI\ component, spread over a large velocity range. 
However, the newly detected diffuse \HI\ component did not solve the problem of missing \HI\ in HCGs. Thus, the question of where is the remaining \HI\ in HCGs still remain. \\
   
If the rest of the gas in HCGs is heated, we would expect to detect hot intragroup X-ray gas in \HI\ deficient groups. However, previous observations showed 
that either most of the detected X-ray gas was confined within the individual member galaxies \citep{2017MNRAS.464..957H} or the properties of the detected
hot intra-group gas among the studied \HI\ deficient sample were very diverse and not correlated with the \HI\ properties \citep{2008MNRAS.388.1245R}. 
In addition, being \HI\ deficient did not necessarily imply the presence of hot intergalactic medium (IGM) gas. For example, HCG 30 is among the most \HI\ 
deficient group, yet no hot IGM was observed \citep{2008MNRAS.388.1245R}. Previous observations also ruled out thermal evaporation as the likely dominant 
mechanisms to remove \HI\ gas in HCGs \citep{2008MNRAS.388.1245R}. As suggested by \citep{2017MNRAS.464..957H}, the missing \HI\ is either too diffuse to be detected or has been ionized and is in the form of a diffuse X-ray gas that is also undetected. The increased sensitivity of new radio telescopes is promising in detecting diffuse
\HI\ component that might have been missed by previous instruments like the VLA or the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT). For example, using the 
Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), \citet{2023ApJ...944..102W} detected faint, extended, diffuse \HI\ emission around the tidally interacting 
NGC 4631 group that was missed by the WSRT. The column density of the diffuse \HI\ was still above the critical column density for photo-ionization and thermal evaporation.
By combining data from the Karoo Array Telescope (KAT-7), WSRT, and The Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey, \citet{2017MNRAS.464..957H} also detected 
faint \HI\ emission in HCG 44, far from the group center. Thus, we expect that part of the missing \HI\ in HCGs is in the form of an extended, diffuse \HI\ that 
was missed by previous observations. \\
   
In an effort to recover the missing \HI\ in HCGs and understand more about the survival of \HI\ in groups, we observed 6 HCGs at intermediate and advanced 
evolutionary stages with MeerKAT. The main scientific goals of the proposal were to:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
    \item understand the transition of HCGs from a complex of \HI\ tidal structures to the most extreme phase, where galaxies seem to have entirely lost their \HI,
    \item determine the distance from the core at which the \HI\ can survive in groups, and assess if magnetic fields aid in this survival within the harsh Intragroup Medium (IGrM),
    \item examine the effects of potential encounters with intruder galaxies located outside the field of view of the VLA,
    \item investigate the previously unexplored role of intragroup gas in the accelerated transition of galaxies from an active to quiescent state.
\end{enumerate}   
This paper is organized as follows. We introduce the individual groups in section~\ref{sample}. We describe the observations and data reduction in section~\ref{observation}. 
We present the results in section~\ref{results} and section~\ref{3dvis}. We summarize the findings and give conclusion in section~\ref{summary}.
\\

\textbf{Reproducibility}: This paper is fully reproducible. We used the Snakemake workflow management system \citet{snakemake} to organize our scripts in terms of "rules" that contain the names of inputs and shell commands to produce different data products, figures, and tables. A single command can then be used to execute the different rules sequentially and produce a final PDF paper. Snakemake is an advanced workflow management system to facilitate reproducibility and encourage transparency in scientific research by automating the execution of complex data analysis steps. This aligns with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and open science policy. All the necessary scripts and data inputs are released along with this paper. 

\section{Sample}\label{sample}
We have chosen 6 HCGs, in which 3 of them are in phase 2 and the other 3 in phase 3. We have omitted groups in phase 1 due to their similarities with galaxies in isolation. 
We have selected phase 2 groups 
since the mechanisms responsible for gas removal, dispersion or depletion are mostly active during this evolutionary stage. In addition, we have included phase 3 groups 
as they represent the most advanced stage of evolution, allowing us to investigate the ultimate fate of the \HI\ gas. To have a coherent view of the evolutionary sequence of \HI\ in HCGs, 
we have included 3 groups in phase 2 and 3 groups in phase 3. We list their properties in Table~\ref{table:sample1} and summarize previous findings below.

\subsection{HCG 16}
% HCG 16 is a group in phase 2 of its evolutionary process. It contains galaxies with a mix of properties, including those with normal \HI content (HCG 16c, HCG16d), which do not contain Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) but host nuclear starburst events, and \HI-deficient galaxies (HCG 16a, HCG16b) that host AGN but have little star formation activity \citep{2019A&A...632A..78J}.
% Its core is composed of only spiral galaxies, namely HCG 16a (NGC 835), HCG 16b (NGC 833), HCG 16c (NGC 838), and HCG 16d (NGC 839). 
% As mentioned previously, its 
The \HI\ spectrum of HCG 16 was obtained by \citet{2010ApJ...710..385B} using the GBT. Besides, HCG 16 was previously 
mapped in \HI\ by the VLA using the C and D array configurations \citep{2001A&A...377..812V, 2019A&A...632A..78J}. \citet{2019A&A...632A..78J} 
found a total mass of $\mathrm{log~}M_{\mathrm{HI}}/M_{\odot}=10.53 \pm 0.05$. This mass is higher than the mass measured by the GBT since a 
significant fraction of the \HI\ in HCG 16 was beyond the reach of the GBT field of view, which was centered at the core of the group. However, 
by weighting the VLA map with the GBT beam response, the measured \HI\ mass obtained by the GBT is about 5\% higher than that of the VLA 
\citep{2010ApJ...710..385B}. \citet{2001A&A...377..812V} found that most of the \HI\ in HCG 16 was found to be in the form of extended features such as tidal tails and bridges \citep[see also][]{2019A&A...632A..78J}. The group members are connected by tidal features. 
The most notable one is the long tidal tail with a projected extent of $160$ kpc, stretching south-east toward NGC 848 from the core of the group. 
% This was believed to be formed by a close encounter of NGC 848 with the core of the group around 400 Myr ago. 
%They also found that only HCG 16a and 
% HCG16b were missing about 80\%  and 90\% of its expected \HI\ mass, respectively, and the rest of the members had normal \HI\ content. Overall,the group 
% as a whole was not found to be \HI\ deficient but was marginally \HI-rich. 
HCG 16 was also observed in H$\alpha$ and R-band by the Survey for Ionization 
in Neutral Gas Galaxies \citep[SINGG,][]{2006ApJS..165..307M}. The observations revealed that all four members of HCG 16 had prominent high surface brightness 
(HSB) nuclear H$\alpha$ emission, with at least three members having  minor-axis outflow. The deep \textit{Chandra} X-ray and VLA-GMRT 1.4 GHz radio continuum 
study of \citet{2014ApJ...793...73O} uncovered the presence of a ridge of diffuse X-ray emission linking the four member galaxies. Their map also showed 
similarities between the hot and cold gas structures, with the diffuse X-ray ridge generally overlapping with the \HI\ filaments, especially the brighter 
ridge connecting NGC 838 and NGC 839. However, the X-ray ridge connecting NGC 838 and NGC 835 did not match well with the \HI\ filaments. \citet{2014ApJ...793...73O} 
detected \HI\, X-ray, and radio continuum emission from the same region, indicating the presence of a multi-phase IGM in HCG 16. 
% They suggested that galactic winds, gravitational infall and collisional shock heating of \HI\ as observed in Stephan's Quintet (HCG 92) were among the mechanisms 
% that contributed to the presence of hot gas in the IGM of HCG 16.    
\subsection{HCG 30}
% HCG 30 is a highly deficient, phase 3a group that is missing about 96\% of its \HI\ mass \citep{2010ApJ...710..385B}. Its core is composed of four members, 
% including three late-type (HCG 30a, HCG 30b, HCG 30c) and one lenticular (HCG 30d) galaxies. 
Previous VLA observations of HCG 30 failed to detect \HI\ in the core of HCG 30 \citep{2023A&A...670A..21J}. 
However, the GBT spectrum of \citet{2010ApJ...710..385B} showed faint, broad \HI\ emission, spread over the whole velocity range of the group, 
suggesting the presence of a diffuse \HI\ component in the group. 
By comparing the VLA flux with that of the GBT, \citet{2010ApJ...710..385B}   
found an excess gas mass fraction of 23\%, corresponding to an \HI\ excess mass of \num{1.45d-8} $M_{\odot}$. Despite being the most \HI\ deficient group \citep{2001A&A...377..812V}, the \textit{Chandra} 
X-ray observations of \citet{2008MNRAS.388.1245R} found no clear evidence of the presence of diffuse IGM emission. Various tests, including an examination of emission across their 
S2 and S3 CCDs and a search for radial gradients in emission did not reveal significant variation or clear spatial variations in diffuse emission. This indicated a consistency 
with the local background. In addition, previous observations failed to detect radio continuum emission in the group, and little far infrared emission (FIR) was observed in the member
galaxies \citep{2007NewAR..51...87V}. The group members also have little H$\alpha$ emission \citep{1998ApJS..117....1V}. Small amounts of H$\alpha$ emission were seen in the central 
region of the barred early-type spiral galaxy HCG 30a and HCG 30c. However, the emission in HCG 30a was contaminated by a nearby bright star, leading to a large error in the 
measured H$\alpha$  emission. The H$\alpha$ emission in the barred late-type spiral galaxy HCG 30b was found in its bulge. No H$\alpha$ emission was found in HCG 30d, a 
lenticular galaxy. Lastly, HCG 30 may have consumed all its molecular gas through star formation as evidenced by the lack of CO detection \citep{1998ApJ...497...89V}.  
\subsection{HCG 31}
% HCG 31 is a phase 2 group, and it 
HCG 31 is one of the most studied compact groups in the literature due to the peculiar characteristics of its members, such as the presence of tidal tails, a merger, and prominent starbursts. 
% It was initially thought to be consisting of four galaxies \citep{1982ApJ...255..382H}: HCG 31(A, B, C, and D). 
% However, HCG 31D was later found to be a background galaxy at higher redshift \citep{1990ApJ...365...86R}. New members were later detected and HCG 31 currently has nine known members: HCG 31(A, B, C, E, F, G, H, R), and a far-off member HCG 31Q \citep{2001ApJ...550..204I, 2023MNRAS.522.2655G}. The group is highly disturbed and two members, HCG 31A and HCG 31C, often referred to as the 
% A+C complex, are thought to be in the process of merging to a single galaxy  
% \citep{1990ApJ...365...86R, 2004ApJ...612L...5A, 2005A&A...430..443V, 2007A&A...471..753A, 2015ApJ...798L..24T, 2023MNRAS.522.2655G}. 
% Some authors consider the A+C complex as a single galaxy or galaxy pairs, NGC 1741, consisting of a double nucleus \citep{1993ApJS...85...27M, 2007A&A...471..753A}. 
% The merging of A and C triggered starbursts in the system, producing several super star clusters (SSCs) and Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars with ages less than 4 Myr \citep{1999AJ....117.1708J}. 
% Two main starbursts were observed in the system, one that occurred about 10 Myr ago, thought to be as a \textit{normal} star formation activity, and a younger one triggered by 
% the interaction between A and C \citep{1997ApJ...479..190I, 2004ApJS..153..243L}. 
All members of HCG 31 were previously detected in \HI. Their \HI\ content range from 10\% to 80\% of the expected values \citep{2005A&A...430..443V}. However, the group as a whole is not deficient in \HI. The \HI\ observations by \citet{2005A&A...430..443V} revealed many tidal features, 
containing 60\% of the total HI mass in HCG 31. In addition, all member galaxies showed signs of interactions. The \HI\ analysis by \citet{2023A&A...670A..21J} using VLA data indicated that most of the \HI\ in HCG 31 was found in the IGrM, although no reliable separation of galaxies and tidal features was possible. Several members of HCG 31, namely E, F, H, and R, were 
considered to be tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs), tidal dwarf candidates, or tidal debris \citep{2003A&A...397...99R, 2004ApJS..153..243L, 2006AJ....132..570M, 2023MNRAS.522.2655G}. 
% \citet{2003A&A...397...99R} suggested that E is part of the A+C complex or in the process of separating from it, and F might be its tidal fragment. \citet{2004ApJS..153..243L} 
% proposed that E and F are TDGs created from an arm-like structure in the southern \HI\ extension of the A+C complex. This view was supported by the similarities between the 
% chemical abundance of E, F and the A+C complex.
Despite the abundance of strong dynamical processes in HCG 31, only weak diffuse X-ray emission was detected in the group 
\citep{2013ApJ...763..121D}. The CO emission in HCG 31 is also faint, with enhanced CO emission found in the overlap region between HCG31A and HCG31C \citep{1997ApJ...475L..21Y}. 
This deficiency in CO was mainly attributed to tidal disruption in the group, rather than a consequence of low metal abundance.  
\subsection{HCG~90}
% HCG 90 is a compact group of galaxies at an advanced evolutionary stage \citep[Phase 3,][]{2023A&A...670A..21J}, where almost no \HI\ remains in the group members. 
% Its core is composed of three interacting galaxies: NGC 7173 (early-type), NGC~7174 (late-type, AGN), and NGC 7176 (early-type).  There is a fourth member, NGC~7172, 
% a Seyfert 2 giant spiral galaxy,  located further north of the three interacting galaxies.  We notice that there are inconsistencies in the literature regarding the 
% naming of the individual members in HCG~90. For example, \citet{2011A&A...525A..86D} used the labeling: NGC~7172/HCG~90a, NGC~7173/HCG 90c, NGC 7174/HCG~90d, and HCG 7176/HCG~90b. 
% \citet{2016MNRAS.463.1284O} adopted the designation: NGC 7172/HCG 92a, NGC~7173/HCG~90b, NGC~7174/HCG~90d, and NGC~7176/HCG~90c. See also \citet{2003ApJ...585..739W} for another 
% naming convention. In this paper, we will use the NGC notation to avoid any confusion, but, if necessary, we will use the nomenclature by \citet{2011A&A...525A..86D} as it is more 
% frequently used in the literature than others. NGC~7174 (HCG~90d) and NGC~7176 (HCG~90b) are strongly interacting with each other and might be in the process of merging as manifested 
% by their prograde orbits and very disturbed velocity fields, with NGC 7174 currently fueling warm gas into NGC 7176 \citep{1998AJ....116.2123P}. Using  the Advanced Camera for Surveys 
% on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), \citet{2015MNRAS.447.3639M} found that about 30\% of the star cluster candidates in the interacting pair NGC 7174/76 have ages less than 400 Myr. 
% The remaining stellar population was consistent with the ages of old globular clusters (GCs). Visual ($V$) and Red ($R$) CCD images taken with the 3.5 m New Technology Telescope at the 
% European Southern Observatory (ESO) by \citet{2003ApJ...585..739W} showed that the three core members of HCG 90 are embedded in large diffuse optical light with surprisingly a very 
% small amount of associated hot intracluster gas. The presence of the diffuse optical light was attributed to tidally stripped stars due to galaxy interactions. The amount of diffuse 
% light in HCG 90 is unprecedented in comparison to either other observations or theoretical expectations involving multiple interacting systems. It has a narrow range of color, 
% consistent with an old stellar population. \citet{2015MNRAS.447.3639M} suggested that the diffuse light existed before the onset of the merger event 
% in HCG 90. The \textit{Chandra} map by \citet{2013ApJ...763..121D} showed bridges of diffuse X-ray emission connecting the three core members, as well as small common envelopes 
% encompassing them. However, no diffuse X-ray emission associated with the IGM was found. HCG 90 were previously imaged in \HI\ by the ATCA and the VLA but only NGC 7172 was 
% detected \citep{1997ASPC..116..358O, 2023A&A...670A..21J}. However, the GBT spectrum of \citet{2010ApJ...710..385B} showed weak \HI\ emission in NGC 7176. The GBT flux 
% suggested an \HI\ deficiency of 92\%. All four members of HCG 90 were also detected in CO \citep{1989ApJ...342..735H, 1992A&A...257..455H, 1997ASPC..117..530V}.   

% HCG 90 is a compact group of galaxies in an advanced evolutionary stage \citep[Phase 3,][]{2023A&A...670A..21J}, with nearly no \HI\ remaining among its members. The core consists of three interacting galaxies: NGC 7173 (early-type), NGC 7174 (late-type, AGN), and NGC 7176 (early-type), with a fourth member, the Seyfert 2 giant spiral galaxy NGC 7172, located further north. There are inconsistencies in the literature regarding the naming of HCG 90 members. For instance, \citet{2011A&A...525A..86D} used labels such as NGC 7172/HCG 90a, while \citet{2016MNRAS.463.1284O} referred to NGC 7172 as HCG 92a. In this paper, we will primarily use the NGC notation but may reference the nomenclature of \citet{2011A&A...525A..86D} for clarity. NGC 7174 (HCG 90d) and NGC 7176 (HCG 90b) are strongly interacting and possibly merging, with NGC 7174 fueling warm gas into NGC 7176 \citep{1998AJ....116.2123P}. \citet{2015MNRAS.447.3639M} found that about 30\% of the star cluster candidates in the interacting pair NGC 7174/76 are less than 400 Myr old, while the remaining population resembles old globular clusters. 
HCG~90 was previously imaged in \HI\ by the ATCA and VLA, with only NGC 7172 detected \citep{1997ASPC..116..358O, 2023A&A...670A..21J}, while weak \HI\ emission in NGC 7176 was indicated by the GBT spectrum \citep{2010ApJ...710..385B}. However, all four members were detected in CO \citep{1989ApJ...342..735H, 1992A&A...257..455H, 1997ASPC..117..530V}.
% CCD images from the 3.5m New Technology Telescope \citep{2003ApJ...585..739W} showed that the core members are embedded in large diffuse optical light, attributed to tidally stripped stars from interactions. The diffuse light in HCG 90 is unprecedented, with a color range consistent with an old stellar population, and may have existed before the merger. The \textit{Chandra} map by \citet{2013ApJ...763..121D} revealed diffuse X-ray emission bridges between the core members but no associated diffuse X-ray emission with the IGM.

encompassing them. However, no diffuse X-ray emission associated with the IGM was found.
\subsection{HCG 91}
% HCG 91 is an actively evolving Phase 2 compact group composed of a quartet of spiral galaxies. 
HCG~91 is heavily discussed in the literature due to the anomalous 
morphologies and kinematics of its members, including the presence of extended tidal tails, bridges, clumps, a double gaseous component, disturbed velocity field, 
and asymmetric rotation curves \citep{2001MNRAS.324..859B, 2003A&A...402..865A, 2003AJ....126.2635M, 2015MNRAS.450.2593V, 2016ApJ...818..115V}. The most pronounced 
tidal feature is the extended tidal tail of the Seyfert 1 galaxy, HCG~91a, pointing toward HCG 91c, and is visible both at optical \citep{2015MNRAS.451.2793E} and 
radio wavelength \citep{2003A&A...402..865A, 2016ApJ...818..115V, 2023A&A...670A..21J}. 
% Using H$\alpha$ imaging obtained from the 4.1m Southern Astrophysics Research 
% (SOAR) Telescope, \citet{2016ApJ...818..115V} detected 10 star-forming regions along the tail of HCG~91a, indicating current star formation induced by interaction. 
% Based on \HI\ kinematics, \citet{2003A&A...402..865A} suggested that the tail of HCG~91a might be the result of a passage of HCG~91c through the group. However, 
% the regular kinematics of HCG~91c, as traced by its ionized and \HI\ gas, and an overall low \HI\ deficiency in HCG~91, led some authors to deduce that this is an 
% early stage encounter \citep{2015MNRAS.451.2793E, 2015MNRAS.450.2593V}.
% Enhanced warm $\mathrm{H_{2}}$ emission has been detected in HCG~91a, suggesting the presence 
% of shock excitation or turbulence heating in the group \citep{2013ApJ...765...93C, 2014A&A...570A..24L, 2015ApJ...812..117A}. The existence of warm $\mathrm{H_{2}}$ and 
% the large star formation suppression value of HCG~91a led \citet{2015ApJ...812..117A} to suggest that HCG~91a is transitioning from star-forming spiral to quiescent 
% early-type galaxy. 
Apart from HCG 91d, all other core members of HCG~91 have been detected previously in \HI. The VLA maps by \citet{2023A&A...670A..21J} showed 
prominent \HI\ tail extending to the east and curving north toward HCG~91c. In addition, HCG~91b and HCG~91c are connected by a weak extended \HI\ emission. 
Overall, the VLA data showed that HCG~91 was moderately deficient in \HI, containing 63\% of the expected amount. At the time of writing, we are not 
aware of any diffuse X-ray emission measurement reported in the literature for this group.   
\subsection{HCG 97}
% HCG 97 is a Phase 3 compact group, consisting of two ellipticals (HCG 97a and HCG 97d), two spirals (HCG 97c and HCG 97b), and one lenticular galaxy (HCG 97e) in its center. 
Out of the five members of HCG 97, only the approaching side of HCG 97b (IC5 359) was previously detected in \HI\ by the VLA map of \citet{2023A&A...670A..21J}, with the receding 
side having too low a signal-to-noise (S/N) to be included as real emission. \citet{2023A&A...670A..21J} suggested that HCG 97b has a disturbed morphology. 
This is in agreement with the LOFAR 144 MHz and VLA (1.4 GHz and 4.86 GHz) maps of \citet{2023MNRAS.tmp.3112H}. They found a radio tail and an extended tail at the western side of HCG 97b. 
% The radio tail is visible at 1.4 GHz and 4.86 GHz. However, the extended tail is only visible at 144 MHz. 
The radio contours are compressed at the southeastern side of the galaxy, suggesting ram-pressure stripping effects. 
\citet{2023MNRAS.tmp.3112H} used the 12m Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and the 7m Atacama Compact Array (ACA) to trace molecular gas in HCG 97b. 
They detected CO emission in the disk of HCG 97 b, but not in the tails. The CO emission shows asymmetric morphology, with the southeast part showing an 'upturn', 
consistent with the optical morphology of the disk. 
% However, the direction of the upturn toward the northeast is inconsistent with the direction of the ram pressure. 
% This inconsistency was attributed to a change in the orbital motion of HCG 97b after its first pericentric passage to the group.  
% \citet{2023MNRAS.tmp.3112H} 
% also detected two off-nuclear X-ray sources in HCG 97b, possibly associated with star-forming regions on either side of the galactic bar. 
Diffuse X-ray emission was previously detected in HCG 97 but without any associated diffuse optical light, optical tidal features or any other (optical) signs of interactions \citep{1995AJ....110.1498P}. 
However, the outer stellar population of HCG 97a were found to be bluer than what was expected from an elliptical galaxy. In addition, its color was 
consistent with the outer envelope of HCG 97d, suggesting a previous exchange of stars between the two galaxies.          

\section{Observations and data reduction}\label{observation}
The data was taken between July 31, 2021, and January 02, 2022, using the full MeerKAT array and a minimum of 61 antennas. 
The L-band receiver (856-1711.974 MHz) was used in its 32k correlator mode. The observations were centered at 1389.1322 MHz 
and a channel width of 26.123 KHz (or 5.5 $\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ at 1420.4 MHz) was used to divide the 856 MHz total bandwidth, 
resulting 32768 channels. The data was recorded with the four linear polarization products of the MeerKAT antenna feeds (XX, XY, YX, and YY). 
For each observing run, the primary calibrator was observed for $\sim$8 minutes at the beginning. This was followed by a cycle of alternating 
observations between the gain calibrator ($\sim$2 minutes) and the target ($\sim$38 minutes), with the primary calibrator revisited every two hours. 
Polarisation calibrators were observed twice for $\sim$6 minutes. The total time spent per group was $\sim$6.25 hours or a total of 37.5 hours, 
including calibration overheads, at 8 seconds integration period for the six HCGs. Table~\ref{table:obs_prop} shows the calibrators used and the observing time spent on each target. \\

The raw data were processed using the CARACal pipeline \citep{2020ASPC..527..635J}. CARACal integrates various radio astronomical software that can be executed through a 
Stimela script \citep{2018PhDT.......215M}, enabling user control over each step of the data processing. To produce a science-ready \HI\ data cube, the raw data 
was passed through three main steps, called workers, in CARACal: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item flagging and cross-calibration,
    \item continuum imaging and self-calibration,
    \item continuum subtraction and line imaging.
\end{enumerate}
CARACal produces various diagnostic plots that can be visually inspected to assess the quality of the data products. Our data was processed on 
a virtual machine of the Spanish Prototype of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Regional Center \citep[espSRC,][]{2022JATIS...8a1004G}. 
The virtual machine has 24 CPUs and 186 GB RAM. The espSRC is hosted by the Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia (IAA-CSIC). 
It serves as a testbed for future scientific activities with the SKA while promoting Open Science and FAIR  principles. We adopt a similar data reduction strategy as described in \citep{2023A&A...673A.146S}. However, our observations consist of a single pointing rather than a mosaic. We describe our data reduction process below. 
\subsection{Flagging and cross-calibration}
Briefly, flagging and cross-calibration were first applied to the calibrators before performing on-the-fly calibration and flagging on the target. 
The detailed steps are as follows. First, autocorrelations and shadowed antennas were flagged using the CASA task \texttt{flagdata} incorporated in CARACal. 
RFI was then flagged using \texttt{AOFlagger} \citep{2012A&A...539A..95O}, which is the default option in CARACal. Next, cross-calibration was performed. 
For the primary calibrator, time-dependent delay calibration ($K$) was first carried out, followed by gain calibration ($G$) while applying the derived $K$ term on the fly. 
After that, bandpass calibration ($B$) was run while applying the previous $K$ and $G$ terms on the fly. This sequence was repeated twice (order: KGBKGB in CARACal) before 
applying the primary calibrator delay and bandpass to the secondary calibrator (apply: KB in CARACal) and solving for gain amplitude and phase. Next, flagging was performed 
to remove spurious calibrated visibilities before solving again for the gain amplitude and phase and additionally bootstrapping the flux scale from the primary 
calibrator (order: GAF and calmode: [ap, null, ap] in CARACal). For the target, on-the-fly calibration, applying the primary calibrator delays and bandpass, 
as well as the secondary calibrator gains, was carried out. Autocorrelations, shadowed antennas, and RFI were also flagged.                    
\subsection{Continuum imaging and self-calibration}
This step is part of the \texttt{selfcal} worker in CARACal to get continuum models and perform self-calibration. High signal-to-noise (S/N) continuum images 
and polarization data will be described in a future paper. Here, we only describe steps relevant for \HI\ line imaging. We use WSClean \citep{2014MNRAS.444..606O} 
for imaging and Cubical \citep{2018MNRAS.478.2399K} for self-calibration. Radio continuum emission was iteratively imaged and self-calibrated. At each step, WSClean 
was allowed to clean blindly down to a 
masking threshold set by us. At each new iteration, the previous clean mask was used to allow for a deeper cleaning. Multi-scale cleaning was used, with scales 
automatically selected by the algorithm. WSclean was run on a 2 deg $\times$ 2 deg image with \SI{1}{\arcsecond} pixel size using Briggs weighting of -1 with \SI{0}{\arcsecond} tapering.  
Three calibration iteration was used, requiring four WSClean imaging with different clean mask threshold (\texttt{auto-mask} option for WSClean): 30, 20, 10, 
and 5 times the rms noise level. The same cleaning threshold, 0.5 (\texttt{auto-threshold} parameter for WSClean),  was used for each imaging option.     
\subsection{Continuum subtraction and line imaging}
The continuum model generated in the previous step was subtracted from the target visibilities. Additionally, doppler-tracking corrections and a first-order 
polynomial fitting to the real and imaginary parts of the line-free channels were carried out with the CASA task \texttt{mstransform} in CARACal. 
Next, any erroneous visibilities produced by \texttt{mstransform} were flagged with AOflagger \citep{2023A&A...673A.146S}. After that, \HI\ data cubes 
were produced with WSClean using different imaging parameters illustrated in Table~\ref{table:sample2}. Multi-scale cleaning was used using a major cycle 
clean gain of 0.2 and scales were automatically selected by WSClean. For each group, we made available cubes at \SI{60}{\arcsecond}, as well as higher resolution cubes down to ~20 kpc linear resolution, roughly corresponding to the scale length of the optical disk. Cubes at intermediate resolutions are also available  
The \SI{60}{\arcsecond} cubes allow the study of extended emission; whereas the higher resolution cubes aid at separating galaxies from tidal tails or intra-group 
gas as previously done by \citet{2023A&A...670A..21J}. To get the final data cubes for each group, we run CARACal to obtain a cube at \SI{98}{\arcsecond}. Then, we run SoFiA outside of CARACal to get a better clean mask. After that, we run CARACal again using that mask to get our 
final lowest-resolution data cube. We again use SoFiA outside of CARACal to get another clean mask and use it to clean the next higher-resolution cube. We proceed like this 
until the highest resolution cube. To correct for primary beam attenuation, we used the model of \citet{2020ApJ...888...61M}. To convert the cubes from frequency to velocity, 
we used the MIRIAD task \texttt{VELSW}. Throughout this paper, we use the optical velocity definition. We also use the \SI{60}{\arcsecond} cube unless stated otherwise.

\section{Results}\label{results}
The basic data products consist of data cubes, moment maps, integrated spectra, and 3D visualization for the group as a whole, as well as source catalogues, cubelettes, 
moment maps, position velocity cuts, and integrated spectra for each source detected by SoFiA. Figure~\ref{figure:data-products} shows examples of data products for NGC~1622 at \SI{43.8}{\arcsecond} $\times$ \SI{47.5}{\arcsecond} resolution, a spiral galaxy in HCG~30. Below we describe the data 
for the individual groups. In general, we detected even more extended tidal features for phase 2 groups than previously observed. For phase 3 groups, 
we did not detect any diffuse \HI\ component, but we detected some new high surface brightness features. In HCG~97 and HCG~91 we detected many 
galaxies surrounding the group center, suggesting that the groups are embedded in larger structures. Some of the detected galaxies do not have optical counterparts. 
% The difference between phase 2 and 3 groups is still abrupt, suggesting a rapid phase transition.  Should be in Lourdes paper

\subsection{GBT vs MeerKAT flux}
To compare our flux measurements with the single dish GBT ones by \citet{2010ApJ...710..385B}, we followed the procedures outlined 
in that paper. They used the AIPS task \texttt{PATGN} to model the GBT beam response as a two-dimensional Gaussian with a FWHM of \SI{9.1}{\arcminute} defined by:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:patgn}
    f(R) = C3 + (C4 - C3)~\exp[-((0.707/C5)^{2}~R^{2})],
\end{equation}
where $R$ is the radius, $C3$ is the minimum response of the beam, which is equal to zero, $C4$ is the maximum response of the beam, 
which is equal to 1, and $C5$ is the width of the distribution in arc second, which in our case, is equal to 9.1~$\times$ 60 / 2.355. 
The output of \texttt{PATGN} is a two-dimensional map containing the GBT beam correction factor. For the sake of reproducibility, 
we wrote a python function to generate the GBT beam response using equation~\ref{eq:patgn}. We multiply 
it with every channel of the MeerKAT cube. Then, we extract the integrated spectrum from the full area of the resulting cube. 
Our procedure ensures that emission outside the primary beam of the GBT is tapered to allow a reasonable comparison 
with the MeerKAT spectrum. We used the original, unsmoothed spectrum of \citet{2010ApJ...710..385B} and divided the observed brightness 
temperature by the antenna gain correction factor, 1.65 K/Jy, measured by the authors to convert it to Jy. We compare the GBT and MeerKAT integrated spectra 
in Figure~\ref{fig:spectrum}. For a better visualization, we have smoothed the spectra from both telescopes to a common velocity resolution 
\qty{20}{km~s^{-1}} using a boxcar kernel. For phase 2 groups, the agreement is good, the MeerKAT and GBT spectra agree well with each other in terms of shape and 
recovered flux. For phase 3 groups, the agreement is less obvious. For HCG 30, MeerKAT recovers less emission around the velocities of HCG30b, HCG30c, and HCG30d. 
For HCG 90, the GBT and MeerKAT spectra seems to agree with each other except around \qty{3500}{km~s^{-1}} where the GBT spectrum shows positive emission. 
For HCG 97, the GBT spectrum shows emission spreading accross a large velocity range. However, that of MeerKAT shows narrower emission. In addition, at virtually each velocity of HCG 97, GBT recovers 
more flux than MeerKAT. Figure~\ref{fig:flux} and Table~\ref{tab:gbt-percentage} compares the flux measured by MeerKAT and GBT within the GBT beam area. For phase 2 groups, there is a good agreement 
between the flux recovered by the GBT and MeerKAT within this area, with the largest flux difference being 22\%. For the groups in phase 3, GBT recovers over 70\% more flux than MeerKAT for HCG 30 and HCG 97, while for HCG 90, MeerKAT recovers 32\% more flux than GBT. This is due to the presence of negative fluxes in the GBT spectrum of HCG 90. Note, that the total flux recovered by MeerKAT is significantly 
higher than that of the GBT due to the much larger field of view of MeerKAT. 
We summarize the observational parameters and derived \HI\ mass of of each group in Table~\ref{table:sample2}. Note that the noise has been estimated using the non-primary beam corrected data. The tabulated mass is from the primary beam corrected cubes. We describe the data products for each group below.

\subsection{HCG 16}
\subsubsection{Data cube}
The final data cube of HCG 16 has a restoring beam size of \SI{57.9}{\arcsecond} $\times$ 
\SI{57.5}{\arcsecond}, which corresponds to a linear resolution of 13.5 kpc $\times$ 13.4 kpc at a distance of 49 Mpc. 
The median noise level for the non-primary beam corrected cube is $\sim0.33~\mathrm{mJy~beam^{-1}}$. This gives a 3$\sigma$ 
column density sensitivity limit of \qty{6.6e+18}{cm^{-2}} over \qty{20}{km~s^{-1}}. We plot the noise level as a function of 
velocity in Figure~\ref{fig:hcg16_noise}. To check for possible artefacts caused by excluding channels containing known \HI\ line 
emission during \texttt{uvlin} fit as described in \citep{2023A&A...673A.146S}, we show a cross-cut of the data cube along the spectral 
dimension at the central declination in Figure~\ref{fig:hcg16_noise}. The noise looks random and we found no obvious cleaning artefacts 
or patterns of continuum residuals. We plot the integrated spectrum of the group in Figure~\ref{fig:hcg16_noise}. The spectrum was 
taken from the primary beam-corrected cube where the noise was blanked using a 3D mask generated by SoFiA. From the global profile, 
we measured a total flux of \qty{42.1}{Jy~km~s^{-1}}, which corresponds to a total mass of \SI{23.8e+9}{} $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ at 49 Mpc. 
We also plot on the same figure the VLA integrated spectrum by \citet{2023A&A...670A..21J}. The total flux measured by the VLA 
is \qty{39.5}{Jy~km~s^{-1}}, giving a total mass of \SI{22.4e+9}{} $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. Note that the MeerKAT and VLA spectra have 
a channel spacing of 5.7 and \qty{21.2}{Jy~km~s^{-1}}, respectively. The most significant discrepancies between the VLA and MeerKAT 
spectra are observed at the velocities corresponding to galaxies HCG 16c and HCG 16d. Note that HCG 16c is the the group's most active 
star-forming galaxy and is strongly interacting with HCG 16d \citep{2023A&A...670A..21J}. The difference between the VLA and MeerKAT 
spectra can be attributed to MeerKAT's capability to detect more tidal features than the VLA. Although MeerKAT detected more \HI\ 
features as will be explained more in the next section, the total mass recovered is remarkably similar to that observed by the VLA.

\subsubsection{Source description}
We show the moment maps of HCG~16 in Figure~\ref{fig:hcg16_mom}. SoFiA detected 10 \HI\ sources. Their properties will be discussed further in a subsequent paper. 
The moment one map in Figure~\ref{fig:hcg16_mom} is plotted in a way that each individual sources are scaled by different color-scaling factor to highlight any rotational 
patterns. While the surrounding sources show differential rotation, the core members do not, and their iso-velocity contours are disturbed.  
The most remarkable finding here is the presence of numerous tidal features and clumps, as well as a long, continuous tidal tail connecting the core member of the group and NGC 848. 
In addition, a hook-like structure extends south-east of NGC 848 before curving to the north west in direction parallel to the main group. To better visualize the tails, 
we show segmented position-velocity diagrams in Figure~\ref{fig:hcg16_pvd} as previously done by \citet{2019A&A...632A..78J} using VLA data. 
The pv-diagrams are taken from the paths shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hcg16_pvd_path}. Most of the tails were previously identified 
by the VLA map of \citet{2019A&A...632A..78J} and we adopt the author's nomenclature to name them. However, the tails are more pronounced in the MeerKAT map. 
Note also that the curved tail (hook) was not visible in the VLA map. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hcg16_pvd_path}, all core members are linked by tails or high column density bridge. 
There is a continuity in velocity between NGC 848S and the curved tail. The hook appears to be a stretched gas from NGC 848 due to its encounter with the main group. 
The presence of numerous tails and clumps are typical of compact groups at the intermediate stage, indicating substantial gas loss into the IGM.

We show example channel maps of the central part of HCG 16 in Figure~\ref{fig:hcg16_chanmap}. The rest is available as online-only materials. 
As also mentioned in \citet{2019A&A...632A..78J}, the NW 
tail is not visible in the chanel map and is merely a projection effect. In contrast, the NE tail is clearly visible and appears to be a dislodged gas from HCG 16c. 
As can be seen from the channel map at $\mathrm{\sim 3966~km~s^{-1}}$, the SE tail is made of gas coming from both NGC 848 and HCG 16d, 
extending across about seven channels. 
The hook feature, becomes more distinct at $\mathrm{\sim 4034~km~s^{-1}}$. The channel maps clearly show the double sided tails of 
HCG 848, i.e., the hook-like feature and part of the gas that makes up the SE tail.

\subsection{HCG 31}
\subsubsection{Data cube}
The data cube of HCG 31 has a beam size of \SI{59.85}{\arcsecond} $\times$ \SI{59.23}{\arcsecond}, giving a linear resolution of 
 15.38 kpc $\times$ 15.22 kpc at 53 Mpc. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hcg31_noise}, the noise looks random and no obvious continuum residual artefacts are visible. 
 The median noise level is $\sim0.33~\mathrm{mJy~beam^{-1}}$, which corresponds to a 
 $3\sigma$ column density sensitivity limit of \qty{6.36e+18}{cm^{-2}} over \qty{20}{km~s^{-1}}. We compare the global spectrum of HCG 31 from the VLA with the MeerkAT profile in 
 Figure~\ref{fig:hcg31_noise}. The total flux from the VLA is \qty{22.1}{Jy~km^{-1}}, giving a total mass of \qty{1.46e+10}{}~$\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. The total 
 flux from MeerKAT is \qty{37.0}{Jy~km^{-1}}, corresponding to a total mass of \SI{2.45e+10}{}~$\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. Thus, MeerKAT recover about 60\% more flux than the VLA. 
 The largest difference in terms of recovered flux corresponds to the A+C complex. Therefore, most of the new tidal features we detected is expected to be coming from the A+C complex. 
 This is not surprising since HCG~31A and HCG~31C is known to be in the process of merging and their interactions are expected to produce many tidal features into the IGM. Note thought 
 that separating features in HCG~31 is extremely challenging \citep{2023A&A...670A..21J} and may require complex kinematic analysis that we will investigate in a future paper.            
 \subsubsection{Source description}
We show the moment maps of HCG~31 in Figure~\ref{fig:hcg31_mom}. SoFiA detected 9 sources around the central members of HCG~31. The latter is detected as one source although 
it is composed of five late-type galaxies and four tidal dwarf candidates. The surrounding sources seem to have differential rotation and present no obvious signs of interactions. 
In contrast, the overall central source is clearly disturbed without any rotational pattern. All the five core member galaxies are embedded in one common \HI\ envelop, which is elongated towards the south-east and the north-west, and was not visible in previous VLA maps. No optical counterparts were found within the elongated region.
We show the column density map of the central part of HCG~31 from a \SI{15.47}{\arcsecond} $\times$ \SI{11.86}{\arcsecond} datacube in 
Figure~\ref{fig:hcg31_optical_mom0}. We also show the previously 
identified tidal fragments and tidal dwarf candidates mentioned in \citet{2006AJ....132..570M}. 
The A+C complex, HCG~31B, and the tidal fragments/dwarf candidates are embedded in high column density features, with the highest contour corresponding to the overlap area between A and C and also to F1. All the tidal 
fragments and the tidal dwarf candidates are embedded in a tail connecting HCG~31~G and the other core members. 
\\\\
Example channel maps of HCG 31 is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hcg31_chanmap}. Visual inspections indicate that the South-Eastern and the north-western 
elongated \HI\ is most likely associated with the A+C complex. Part of the northern extension could be coming from HCG~31Q, though. The elongation of the South-Eastern 
tail is likely a result of gas being stripped away during the interaction between HCG~31A and HCG~31C, which then subsequently extended by a fly-by encounter between 
member G and the A+C complex. There are no known optical counterparts associated with the extended \HI\ emission. Thus, they are not the results of interactions with members outside the central galaxies. The highest \HI\ peak is associated with HCG~31C, which also corresponds to sites of active star forming regions.

\subsection{HCG 91}
\subsubsection{Data cube}
The data cube of HCG 91 has synthesized beam size of \SI{57.96}{\arcsecond} $\times$ \SI{56.13}{\arcsecond}, with a median rms noise level of \qty{0.33}{mJy~beam^{-1}}. 
This corresponds to a 3$\sigma$ column density sensitivity limit of \qty{6.3e+18}{cm^{-2}} over \qty{20}{km~s^{-1}}. The velocity-position plot in Figure~\ref{fig:hcg91_noise} 
shows subtle vertical stripes at velocities corresponding to channels excluded during UVLIN fit. The effects can be seen in the noise-velocity plot in the middle panel of 
Figure~\ref{fig:hcg91_noise} where the noise increases at the channels where known emission is excluded while performing UVLIN fit. Unfortunately, we cannot correct for such effects. 
This is inherent to UVLIN as described in \citet{2023A&A...673A.146S}. We show the global profiles of HCG 91 from the VLA and MeerKAT in Figure~\ref{fig:hcg91_global_prof}. 
The recovered flux by the VLA is \qty{15.8}{Jy~km~s^{-1}}, corresponding to a total mass of \qty{3.1e+10}{} $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. The recovered flux by MeerKAT (considering only those having 
velocities between 6000 and 8000) is \qty{27.5}{Jy~km~s^{-1}}, 
giving a total mass of \qty{5.5e+10}{} $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. Thus, within this velocity range, MeerKAT recovers 57\% more flux than the VLA. Part of the difference is due to the larger field of view of MeerKAT since we detect more sources beyond the VLA coverage area. As shown in the global profiles, there are many sources beyond this velocity range and some or many of them might still belong to the groups. A more careful studies of them will be done in a subsequent paper. 
\subsubsection{Source description}
We show the moment maps of HCG~91 in Figure~\ref{fig:hcg91_chanmap}. We have detected many sources in HCG~91 but only those within \qty{1000}{km~s^{-1}} from the systemic velocity are shown here. On projection, the core members and a far-off members at the west side, LEDA 749936, are embedded 
in one common \HI\ envelop. Two \HI\ bridges connect HCG~91b and HCG~91c. The first was identified previously by \citet{2023A&A...670A..21J} which they separated as intra-group gas. 
The second one extends to the west from HCG~91c before curving toward the north to join another extended feature of HCG~91b. In addition, it seems to elongate towards LEDA 749936. 
Another higher S/N emission connects HCG~91c and HCG~91a. All the core members of HCG~91, including the detection slightly far west are detected as one source by SoFiA, highlighting 
the complex interactions between the members. We also show the velocity fields of the galaxies in the core of HCG~91 in Figure~\ref{fig:hcg91_mom_cores} from a data cube 
at \SI{24.0}{\arcsecond} $\times$ \SI{20.2}{\arcsecond}. We also show their DeCaLS optical image along with their \HI\ iso-velocity contours. Their optical major axis position angle are 
well aligned with their \HI\ major axis position angle. However, the outer disk of HCG~91b is warped. \\
HCG~91a has asymmetric double-horned profiles, typical of spiral galaxies. Its main disk still has a clear rotational pattern; however, 
its halo is disturbed. HCG~91c also has asymmetric double-horned profiles. In addition, its main disk has retained rotation despite the interaction with other members. The blue-shifted 
velocity field of HCG~91b is more or less regular, except the warp mentioned earlier. However, the red-shifted part is clearly disturbed due to the interaction with HCG~91c. The \HI\ emission in LEDA 749936 has 
very low S/N and its velocity field is disturbed. It has a single peaked global profile, typical of dwarf galaxies.  We detect many sources around the central part of HCG~91. They seem to 
have regular rotation. However, a group of four strongly interacting galaxies can be seen South-East the core members. Their \HI\ velocity fields and morphologies are clearly disturbed. 
In addition, two interacting galaxies are found further East. Note though that their systemic velocities differ by about \qty{1500}{km~s^{-1}} than those of the core groups.   
\\\\
We show example channel maps of HCG~91 in \ref{fig:hcg91_chanmap}, which contain the SE tail of HCG~91a. Some of the 2$\sigma$ contours of HCG~91a bend toward the north, and appear 
to be aligned with its optical tails. In addition, the curved \HI\ emission which apparently connect HCG~91c and HCG~91d in projection appears as broken contours of low-column density 
gas coming from both HCG~91c and HCG~91b. Lastly, the channel maps show no \HI\ emission at the velocity and location of HCG~91d. This galaxy has never been detected in \HI\ emission 
before \citep{2023A&A...670A..21J}.

\subsection{HCG 30}
\subsubsection{Data cube}
The data cube of HCG~30 has a synthesized beam size of \SI{60.47}{\arcsecond} $\times$ \SI{59.77}{\arcsecond}, with a 3$\sigma$ column density sensitivity limit of \qty{6.1e+18}{cm^{-2}} 
over \qty{20}{km~s^{-1}}. The noise is well-behaved, without any apparent signs of continuum residuals or cleaning artefacts. The global profile is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hcg30_noise}. 
The recovered flux from MeerKAT is \qty{40.05}{Jy~km~s^{-1}}, giving a total mass of \qty{3.51e+10}{} $M_{\odot}$. The recovered flux from the VLA is \qty{15.14}{Jy~km~s^{-1}}, 
corresponding to a total mass of \qty{1.3e+10}{} $M_{\odot}$. 
\subsubsection{Source description}
HCG~30 is one of the most \HI\ deficient groups in our sample and previous observations failed to detect any \HI\ emission in the galaxies making up its core. However, 
we detect \HI\ emission at the location of HCG~30b and HCG~30c. The \HI\ emission corresponding to HCG~30b was splitted as three sources by SoFiA. We combined the three 
individual cubelettes from SoFiA using the MIRIAD task \texttt{IMCOMB} and rederived the moment maps, which we show in Figure~\ref{fig:hcg30b}. These plots were generated 
using the SoFiA Image Pipeline (SIP) by Hess K.M. (\href{https://github.com/kmhess/SoFiA-image-pipeline}{https://github.com/kmhess/SoFiA-image-pipeline}). The moment one 
map presents apparent signs of rotation but the iso-velocity contours do not show the spider patterns expected from Sa galaxies. Instead, they show systematically convex 
curvatures. Note though that the emission along the minor axis is barely resolved. The global \HI\ profile exhibits an enhanced intensity at either side of a more subdued 
central peak. However, the overall S/N of the profile is low.  We detect \HI\ emission corresponding 
to the location of HCG~31c. The systemic velocity we got from SIP, \qty{4519}{km~s^{-1}}, corresponds well to the one quoted by \citet{2023A&A...670A..21J}, \qty{4508}{km~s^{-1}}, 
from its optical redshift. However, the emission is faint and is barely resolved. We show the overview plots of HCG~30c from SIP in \ref{fig:hcg30c}. Disk rotation is not detected due 
to insufficient S/N ratio and resolution elements. The \HI\ detection in HCG~30a remains spurious and unresolved despite being a large spiral galaxy.   
\\\\
We present the example channel maps of HCG~30 in Figure~\ref{fig:hcg30_chanmap}. These only show the channels corresponding to the receding side of HCG~30b, the rest is presented 
as online-only material. Overall, the emission is faint and is mostly below the 3$\sigma$ detection threshold.

\subsection{HCG 90}
\subsubsection{Data cube}
The synthesized beam size of HCG~90 is \qty{57.73}{\arcsecond} $\times$ \qty{56.66}{\arcsecond}, with a 3$\sigma$ noise level of \qty{0.32}{mJy~beam^{-1}}, giving a 
column density sensitivity level of \qty{6.4e+18}{cm^{-2}} over \qty{20}{km~s^{-1}}. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hcg90_noise}, the noise behaves quite well. 
The comparison between the VLA and the MeerKAT global profile is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hcg90_global_prof}. Since the VLA observations only detected \HI\ emission in HCG~90a, 
the MeerKAT global profile appears much brighter than that of the VLA since MeerKAT detects emission both at the central part and in the vicinity of HCG~90. The total flux 
from MeerKAT is \qty{40.85}{Jy~km~s^{-1}}, giving a total mass of \qty{10.45e+9}{} $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. The total flux from the VLA is \qty{33.53}{Jy~km~s^{-1}}, 
yielding a total mass of \qty{8.60e+8}{} $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$.
\subsubsection{Source description}
The moment maps of HCG~90 are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hcg90_mom}. We detect an \HI\ tail in the central region of HCG~90. When plotted against a deep DECaLS image, 
the \HI\ tail seems to be aligned with the optical tail. It has a total mass of \qty{2.81e+8}{} $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. On projection, it is difficult to assess which members the tails are associated with. However, 
part of the tails coincides with the location of HCG90b and HCG90d. Previous H$\alpha$ kinematics by \citet{1998AJ....116.2123P} shows evidence of ongoing interaction 
between HCG~90b and HCG~90d, with HCG~90d acting as a gas provider. Spatially, the northern tail coincides more with the location of HCG~90d than that of HCG~90b. 
We also show in Figure~\ref{fig:hcg90_mom} a position-velocity map of the tail taken from a thick slice shown at the top right panel of the figure. A continuity in velocity 
is clearly visible, which indicates that it is not an isolated feature. A more 
compact \HI\ structure is found further north of HCG~90c, at the south western side of HCG~90a. 
We therefore hypothesize that the observed tail is part of a more extended structure connecting HCG~90c with the other members, which may have escaped our detection, 
or have already been dispersed by other processes such as ionisation or star formation.
HCG~90a has been detected before by the VLA, which we also clearly detect 
with MeerKAT. \\\\
We show example channel maps of the central part of HCG~90 in Figure~\ref{fig:hcg90_chanmap}. The tail described previously appears as broken contours of low-column density \HI, with the 
brightest contour found at 2271 to 2293 $\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$, at the southern optical tail. No 3-$\sigma$ contour is found at the location of HCG~90b, HCG~90c, and HCG~90d.

\subsubsection{Data cube}
The beam size is \qty{57.73}{\arcsecond} $\times$ \qty{56.66}{\arcsecond}, with a median noise level of \qty{0.32}{mJy~beam^{-1}} and a 3$\sigma$ 
column density sensitivity level of \qty{6.56e+18}{cm^{-2}} over \qty{20}{km~s^{-1}}. The data cube has subtle continuum residuals as shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:hcg97_noise}. The comparison between the VLA global profile and that of MeerKAT is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:hcg97_global_prof}.  
Another \HI\ emission peak beyond the velocity covered by the VLA is detected by MeerKAT. The total flux 
recovered by the VLA is \qty{7.00}{Jy~km~s^{-1}}, compared to \qty{17.75}{Jy~km~s^{-1}} for the MeerKAT. These correspond to a total mass of 
\qty{1.19e+10}{} $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and \qty{30.21e+9}{} $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, respectively. 
\subsubsection{Source description}
The moment maps are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hcg97_mom}. Many sources are detected beyond the central part of HCG~97. 
However, none are detected in HCG~97a, 
HCG~97c, HCG~97d, and HCG~97e. Only HCG~97b is detected, whose approaching side was also detected by the VLA \citep{2023A&A...670A..21J}. 
\citet{2023A&A...670A..21J} suggested that HCG~97b might be disturbed since they only detected one side of the galaxy. However, we do not 
see any \HI\ extension in our map despite the fact that MeerKAT detected the two sides of the galaxies. The receding part of this galaxy is indeed fainter 
as previously mentioned by \citet{2023A&A...670A..21J}. HCG~97b is an edge-on spiral galaxy, but its velocity field is typical of a dwarf with solid body 
rotation curve. This is also corroborated by the position velocity diagram shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hcg97_mom}. 
However, the position-velocity diagram shows that HCG~97 has a very steep inner rotation curve, which most spirals with flat rotation curve also have \citep{1978PhDT.......195B}. 
If this galaxy has a flat rotation curve, then we are only probing its inner disk, corresponding to the rising part of the rotation curve. 
Its outer disk might be too faint to be detected. Thus, we do not exclude the possibility that this galaxy is interacting.

\section{3D visualization}\label{3dvis}

\citet{2016ApJ...818..115V} introduced a new way to explore and share 3D data cubes. 
It leverages upon the X3D file format, an open-source format that supports detailed 3D representations 
to facilitate the development of interactive HTML documents, 3D printing models, and high-end animations, 
making complex datasets more accessible and comprehensible. 
For the studies of HCGs, \citet{2017IAUS..321..241V} used the 
X3D pathway to facilitate the separation of different HI structures based on spatial and kinematical information, 
surpassing previous methods that relied on channel and moment maps. 
The study quantified high surface brightness \HI\ in intragroup features of various HCGs using the X3D tool. 
The results showed a correlation between the \HI\ mass in the IGrM and the total HI deficiency, 
suggesting that as HCGs evolve towards increased HI deficiency, they go through a phase of intensive tidal stripping.
 This phase may be related to the transition of MoHEG (Molecular Hydrogen Emitting Galaxies) 
 from star-forming to quiescent states, with enhanced H2 emission potentially energized by shocks 
 from collisions within the cold IGrM. For this paper, 3D visualization though the X3D pathway is available at 
 \href{https://amiga.iaa.csic.es/x3d-menu/}{https://amiga.iaa.csic.es/x3d-menu/}. The technical aspect of this is described in an accompanying paper. For phase two groups, 
 the 3D data is very important to separate the intra-group gas from the galaxy disk in order to estimate 
 the amount of (observed) stripped gas by tidal interactions and its relationship with the deficiency of the group. Doing so is beyond 
 the scope of this paper and is done in an accompanying paper. In general, the intricate tidal structures observed for phase two groups  
 can still be separated by visually inspecting the highest resolution of the data. 
 The 3D visualisations may not be particularly useful for Phase 3 groups unless the users want to visualize the individual galaxies. 
 Example snapshots of the 3D view of HCG~16 are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hcg16-x3d}. They show contours of high and low 
 column density gas with different colors. Visualizing the cubes this way with different orientation enables us to get a better 
 grasp of the complex features in the groups. The solid circles in the Figures show the position of the individual members. 
 The Figures highlight how these members are connected by  
 a complex network of \HI\ tails, bridges, and clumps. The hook is mostly composed of lower column density gas stretched from NGC~848. 
 The apparent broken SE tail observed by the VLA \citep{2019A&A...632A..78J} connecting NGC 848 and its core members appear as a cohesive structure in 
 the MeerKAT data.

\section{Summary and conclusion}\label{summary}
We presented MeerKAT \HI\ observations of six HCGs in phase 2 and phase 3. The data is crucial to understand the transition 
between phase 2 and phase 3 groups. We aimed to detect diffuse \HI\ gas that was apparent in previous 
GBT observations but missed by the VLA telescope. Our observations revealed significantly more extended 
tidal features in phase 2 groups compared to those detected by the VLA. In addition, we detected new high 
surface brightness features in phase 3 groups. The presence of tidal features, such as \HI\ tails, bridges, 
and clumps, suggests substantial gas loss into the IGrM due to gravitational interactions. 
Despite MeerKAT's increased sensitivity, no diffuse \HI\ component was found in phase 3 groups, indicating an abrupt 
transition between these phases and that the missing \HI\ could either be ionized or too diffuse to be detected by MeerKAT. 
Numerous surrounding galaxies were detected for both phase 2 and phase 3 groups, most of which are normal disk galaxies. 
This suggests that these groups might be embedded in larger structures. The significant difference in \HI\ extent between 
the VLA and MeerKAT indicates that the \HI\ in phase~2 groups might be spread over even larger angular scales than what 
MeerKAT is able to cover, highlighting the need for more sensitive telescopes like FAST to fully capture their \HI\ edge. 
Apart from the conventional data cubes, source catalogues, and moment maps, we have released 3D visualization of our data. 
This offers a more advanced approach to visually inspect different \HI\ features, 
which can help in separating the complex substructures present in phase 2 groups.
